# ADONIS Bootcamp's final challenge
## Project Overview 

This repo contains a RESTFUL API that was made using the Adonis framework. The main purpose of this project was the desire to apply different web-development concepts such as middlewares, JWT and password encryption, also, for a better understanding of back-end architectures. The back-end is connected to a PostgreSQL database.
